        <p>After an election, how can citizens hold elected leaders accountable for promises that they made during the campaign season? Promise Tracker explores the role citizen monitoring can play in holding elected leaders accountable for promises they make about infrastructure.</p>

				<h2>Citizen Monitoring</h2>
		 
       			<p>The MIT Center for Civic Media is currently building Promise Tracker, a web-based tool and complementary set of practices that provides citizens with the capacity to monitor and hold elected officials accountable to the promises they make.  Promise Tracker explores the role of citizens in gathering data and promoting accountability between election cycles. <br><br>Promise Tracker includes a form builder and mobile phone tool for data collection, allowing citizens to deploy data collection campaigns based around specific government commitments. The tool is currently being built and tested in partnership with organizations in Belo Horizonte and Sao Paulo, Brazil.</p>

				<h2>Initial Design Workshops</h2>
				<img src="img/workshopimage.jpg" align="left" style="padding-right:30px; padding-top: 5px;">
				<p>The Promise Tracker team has conducted initial design workshops in São Paulo and Belo Horizonte, Brazil in collaboration with local partners. During each workshop, participants identified issues and infrastructure to monitor, collected data using Android mobile phones, and created data presentations based on the data they collected. Groups focused on issues ranging from public safety and accessibility (the availability of handrails on staircases) to litter in public parks to access to affordable housing.</p>
				<p>In Belo Horizonte, we collaborated with Minas Gerais Office of Strategic Priorities and a community group called UBRAFRA. In São Paulo, we partnered with Rede Nossa São Paulo, a network of community organizations dedicated to create stronger links between citizens and their government. Through Nossa São Paulo, we worked with a group of citizens recently elected to monitor a specific set of promises that the Mayor has committed to achieving.</p>

				<p>Promise Tracker is a project of the <a href="http://civic.mit.edu/">Center for Civic Media</a>, a research group at MIT that works hand in hand with diverse communities to collaboratively create, design, deploy, and assess civic media tools and practices.

<br><br>We are inventors of new technologies that support and foster civic media and political action, we are a hub for the study of these technologies, and we coordinate community-based design processes locally in the Boston area, across the United States, and around the world.</p>
